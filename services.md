# My Services

## Enhancing Your Industrial Software with Strategic AI

As your dedicated {{ site.my_role }} with over {{ site.n_exp_years }} years of experience applying advanced data analysis & AI principles, I partner with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and technology companies to elevate their industrial software solutions. My focus is on integrating advanced, reliable AI capabilities that deliver tangible value to you and your end-users. I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI methodologies and the practical realities of industrial applications, ensuring solutions are not just innovative, but also robust, scalable, and production-ready.

## Areas of Expertise: How I Help Your Software Excel

My services are designed to address the specific challenges and opportunities faced by providers of Predictive Maintenance (PdM), Condition Monitoring (CM), Asset Performance Management (APM), and Industrial IoT (IIoT) analytics software:

---

## 1. Advanced Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Solutions

</div>

**Empower your software with more accurate, reliable, and insightful PdM capabilities.**
Drawing on my experience developing and deploying diagnostic algorithms for critical assets in the energy sector (e.g., for an EDF subsidiary's SaaS product monitoring power plants and data centers), I can help you:

- **Develop & Refine Anomaly Detection Models:** Implement sophisticated algorithms (beyond simple thresholds) to identify subtle deviations and early warning signs with higher sensitivity and fewer false positives. This means more trustworthy alerts for your users.
- **Enhance Performance Diagnostics & Prognostics:** Build models to diagnose root causes of performance degradation and, where applicable, estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for key components.
- **Improve Existing Model Performance:** Leverage advanced statistical techniques, feature engineering, and robust benchmarking to increase the accuracy and reliability of your current predictive models.
  - _Example: My work at an PdM SaaS provider involved complementing physics-based models with statistical/ML approaches, significantly reducing calibration times while often maintaining or improving accuracy._

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Enhance your software's core predictive power, reduce false positives for your users, increase the reliability and value of your PdM offerings, and differentiate your product in the market.

</div>

**Ensure your AI models are built on a foundation of high-quality, reliable data.**
Industrial sensor data is often complex, heterogeneous, and noisy. My experience in astrophysics (handling petabytes of complex data) and at an PdM SaaS provider (processing diverse client data from >10 industrial plants) has equipped me to:

- **Design & Implement Custom ETL Pipelines:** Develop automated workflows to ingest, clean, validate, transform, and structure raw sensor data, making it ready for advanced analytics.
- **Automate Data Quality Checks & Anomaly Correction:** Implement AI-empowered plausibility checks and routines for automated data cleansing and interpolation, ensuring data consistency.
- **Optimize Data Handling for Scalability:** Build pipelines that can efficiently process large volumes of time-series data.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Build a reliable data foundation for all your analytics, ensure your algorithms perform optimally by feeding them clean, well-structured data, and reduce manual data preparation efforts for your team and your clients.

</div>

**Transition your AI innovations from proof-of-concept to robust, production-grade features.**
For ISVs, deploying and maintaining AI models at scale is crucial. I provide expertise in:

- **Containerization & API Development:** Packaging models (e.g., using Docker) and exposing them via scalable REST APIs (Flask/FastAPI) for easy integration into your software.
- **CI/CD for ML:** Implementing pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for continuous integration, testing, and deployment of ML models.
- **Model Monitoring & Versioning:** Setting up systems (e.g., MLflow, Grafana) to track model performance in production, manage versions, and facilitate retraining.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Accelerate the deployment of new AI features, ensure your AI systems are scalable, maintainable, and consistently deliver value in real-world operational environments, and reduce the technical debt associated with AI integration.

</div>

**Unlock new efficiencies and insights by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) within your industrial software.**
Beyond core PdM, GenAI offers exciting opportunities to enhance user experience and extract value from unstructured data:

- **Custom RAG Systems & Intelligent Chatbots:** Develop AI assistants that provide fast, context-aware answers to technical questions by drawing on your proprietary knowledge bases (e.g., technical manuals, maintenance logs, manufacturer or operator documentation).
  <!-- - _Examples: My projects include building RAG systems like the [NutritionFacts Chatbot](https://nutrify-your-life.streamlit.app/) and my [Personal Digital Twin](https://alex-kolodzig-cv.streamlit.app/My_Digital_Twin)._ -->
- **Automated Reporting & Insight Summarization:** Utilize LLMs to intelligently summarize asset conditions, maintenance events, or complex log files, presenting key information clearly and concisely.
- **Enhanced Data Interaction & Feature Discovery:** Explore how GenAI can help analyze unstructured data to find relevant features for PdM models or support engineers in their diagnostic workflows.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Add innovative, value-added GenAI features to your software, improve the efficiency of service teams and engineers, enhance knowledge accessibility, and create new ways for users to interact with complex industrial information.
