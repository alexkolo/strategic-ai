</div>

**Empower your software with more accurate, reliable, and insightful PdM capabilities.**
Drawing on my experience developing and deploying diagnostic algorithms for critical assets in the energy sector (e.g., for an EDF subsidiary's SaaS product monitoring power plants and data centers), I can help you:

- **Develop & Refine Anomaly Detection Models:** Implement sophisticated algorithms (beyond simple thresholds) to identify subtle deviations and early warning signs with higher sensitivity and fewer false positives. This means more trustworthy alerts for your users.
- **Enhance Performance Diagnostics & Prognostics:** Build models to diagnose root causes of performance degradation and, where applicable, estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for key components.
- **Improve Existing Model Performance:** Leverage advanced statistical techniques, feature engineering, and robust benchmarking to increase the accuracy and reliability of your current predictive models.
  - _Example: My work at an PdM SaaS provider involved complementing physics-based models with statistical/ML approaches, significantly reducing calibration times while often maintaining or improving accuracy._

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Enhance your software's core predictive power, reduce false positives for your users, increase the reliability and value of your PdM offerings, and differentiate your product in the market.

</div>

**Ensure your AI models are built on a foundation of high-quality, reliable data.**
Industrial sensor data is often complex, heterogeneous, and noisy. My experience in astrophysics (handling petabytes of complex data) and at an PdM SaaS provider (processing diverse client data from >10 industrial plants) has equipped me to:

- **Design & Implement Custom ETL Pipelines:** Develop automated workflows to ingest, clean, validate, transform, and structure raw sensor data, making it ready for advanced analytics within your software.
- **Automate Data Quality Checks & Anomaly Correction:** Implement AI-empowered plausibility checks and routines for automated data cleansing and interpolation, ensuring data consistency for your models.
- **Optimize Data Handling for Scalability:** Build pipelines that can efficiently process large volumes of time-series data, supporting the growth of your user base.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Build a reliable data foundation for all analytics in your product, ensure your algorithms perform optimally, and reduce manual data preparation efforts that might otherwise fall on your team or your clients.

</div>

**Transition your AI innovations from proof-of-concept to robust, production-grade features within your software.**
For ISVs, deploying and maintaining AI models at scale is crucial. I provide expertise in:

- **Containerization & API Development:** Packaging models (e.g., using Docker) and exposing them via scalable REST APIs (Flask/FastAPI) for seamless integration into your software architecture.
- **CI/CD for ML:** Implementing pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for continuous integration, testing, and deployment of ML models that power your product features.
- **Model Monitoring & Versioning:** Setting up systems (e.g., MLflow, Grafana) to track model performance in production, manage versions, and facilitate retraining, ensuring your AI features remain effective.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Accelerate the deployment of new AI features, ensure your AI systems are scalable, maintainable, and consistently deliver value in real-world operational environments, and reduce the technical debt associated with AI integration in your products.

</div>

**Unlock new efficiencies and insights by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) within your industrial software.**
Beyond core PdM, GenAI offers exciting opportunities to enhance user experience and extract value from unstructured data within your product offerings:

- **Custom RAG Systems & Intelligent Chatbots for Your Software:** Develop AI assistants that provide fast, context-aware answers to technical questions by drawing on knowledge bases relevant to your software's domain or your clients' industrial data (e.g., technical manuals for equipment your software monitors, maintenance logs).
- **Automated Reporting & Insight Summarization Features:** Utilize LLMs to intelligently summarize asset conditions, maintenance events, or complex log files within your software, presenting key information clearly and concisely to your users.
- **Enhanced Data Interaction & Feature Discovery in Your Product:** Explore how GenAI can help analyze unstructured data to find relevant features for PdM models or support engineers in their diagnostic workflows when using your software.

**Benefit for your ISV/Tech Company:** Add innovative, value-added GenAI features to your software, improve the efficiency of your clients' service teams and engineers, enhance knowledge accessibility within your product, and create new ways for users to interact with complex industrial information through your platform.
